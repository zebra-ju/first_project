<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

\***************

---------------

____________

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement ___DRY___ principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

### Installation

*Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.*

1. Get a free API Key at https://example.com
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Enter your API in config.js
```js
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
```sh
git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
git remote -v # confirm the changes
```
